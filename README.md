Project Title:
Vehicle Parking Management System

Project Description:
The Vehicle Parking Management System is a SQL-based solution designed to efficiently manage parking spaces in a parking facility. The system automates the process of vehicle entry, exit, and parking space allocation, ensuring optimal utilization of parking spaces. The system also keeps track of the parking duration, calculates charges based on time, and provides an efficient way to monitor parking space availability.
The system aims to reduce congestion, minimize administrative overhead, and ensure smooth operations in parking facilities. It provides features like real-time parking space availability, automated vehicle entry/exit registration, and dynamic parking fee calculations based on the duration of the vehicleâ€™s stay.

Key Features:
Vehicle Entry & Exit Management:
The system records the entry and exit of vehicles, assigning parking spaces dynamically based on availability.
Each vehicle is logged with relevant details (e.g., vehicle number, entry time, exit time, etc.).
Parking Space Allocation:
The system ensures that the parking space allocation is optimized, preventing any underutilization of available spaces.
Different parking zones may be available based on factors like vehicle type or user preference (e.g., compact, regular, VIP spaces).
Fee Calculation:
The system calculates parking charges dynamically based on the duration of the vehicle's stay.
Charges may differ depending on factors such as the parking duration, type of vehicle, or specific zones.
Real-Time Availability Tracking:
Users can view the real-time status of parking spaces (available or occupied), which can be accessed through a dashboard or interface.
This helps optimize parking operations and avoid congestion.
Audit Logging:
The system maintains a detailed log of vehicle entries and exits, along with timestamps, vehicle details, and parking fee calculations.
This log serves as an audit trail for monitoring vehicle movements and parking fee collection.
Technologies Used:
SQL & PL/SQL:
Used to define the database structure, create the necessary tables for parking spaces, vehicle information, and fee calculations, and implement stored procedures for managing vehicle entry and exit.

Database Systems:
The system can be implemented on Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL databases, providing a reliable and scalable foundation for managing parking operations.

Guidance:
This project was developed under the guidance of Sir Aniruddha Gaikwad.
